PHP Fullname Parser
===============

Split a full name into it's various parts (salutation, first, last, etc)


The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent algorithm for splitting full names into the following parts:

Salutation
First Name
Initials
Last Name
Suffix
This project also attempts to fix some common formatting issues like capitalization.


The main things on the to-do list are:
====================================
* refactor as a PHP class
* separate splitting from formatting
* remove any words in parenthesis (not just 1 word)
* handle the "Lname, Fname" format
* pull out the various dictionaries and make them easier to modify
* add rule to capitalize two letter names w/ no vowels (ex. "JP" but not "Jo")
* add common name libraries to allow for things like gender detection
